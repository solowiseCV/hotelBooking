## Explain version control.

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
Here are some concepts of version control

 - Repository:
    A repository (repo) is a central storage location where all the files, history, and metadata related to a project are stored.
    Repositories can be either centralized (single repository on a server) or distributed 

 - Commits:
    A commit represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.
     It includes changes made to files, a commit message describing the changes, and metadata like the author and timestamp. 

 - Branching:
   Branching allows for the creation of separate lines of development within a repository.
   Each branch is an independent series of commits, and users can work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase until they are ready to merge their changes.  

 - Merging:
     Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another.
     It is typically used to integrate new features or bug fixes back into the main branch.

 - Remote Repository:  
     In distributed version control systems, there is often a remote repository that serves as a central point for collaboration.
      Users can push their changes to the remote repository and pull changes from it to stay synchronized with the latest developments.  

 - History: 
     Version control systems maintain a complete history of changes made to a project, allowing users to review and revert to previous states if needed.
      This historical record helps in understanding who made a particular change, when it was made, and why.
